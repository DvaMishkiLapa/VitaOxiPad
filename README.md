## 1. Description

**VitaOxiPad** is a [client-server application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) that turns your PS Vita into (almost) a DualShock 4.
The PS Vita acts as a server to which the PC client will be connected within the local network (WiFi).

## 2. Installation

### 2.1 Client

**Install the Client on Windows:**

1. Download the latest `VitaOxiPad-x64.exe` or `VitaOxiPad-x32.exe` from the [releases page](https://github.com/DvaMishkiLapa/VitaOxiPad/releases);
1. Install [ViGEmBus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases) on your PC;
1. Run the `VitaOxiPad-x64.exe` or `VitaOxiPad-x32.exe` in the console (PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Bash, etc) and enter your PS Vita's IP address.

**Install the Client on Linux:**

Unfortunately, building static files is not supported for Linux at this time. [You will need to build the Client yourself](./Build.md).

### 2.2 Server

1. Ensure your PS Vita is set up for homebrew applications;
1. Download the `VitaOxiPad.vpk` file;
1. Use VitaShell or another package manager to install the `.vpk` on your PS Vita.

## 3. Uses and options

```bash
$ VitaOxiPad-x64.exe --help
Usage: VitaOxiPad-x64.exe <ip> [-p <port>] [-c <config>] [--polling-interval <polling-interval>] [-d]

Create a virtual controller and fetch its data from a Vita over the network.

Positional Arguments:
  ip                IP address of the Vita to connect to

Options:
  -p, --port        port to connect to (default: 5000)
  -c, --config      buttons and touchpads config (default: standart)
  --polling-interval
                    polling interval in microseconds (minimum = 6000)
  -d, --debug       enable debug mode
  -v, --version     show version information
  -s, --sample-config
                    print sample config file
  --help            display usage information
```

### 3.1 Saving Configs

VitaOxiPad searches for the config file in the following locations:

- **Current Executable Directory**: `config.toml`
- **User's Home Directory**: `~/vitaoxipad.toml` or `~/.config/vitaoxipad.toml`
- **Windows Path**: `C:\Users\%username%\vitaoxipad\vitaoxipad.toml`

If no config file is found, default settings will be used.

With the `--sample-config` feature, you can generate a sample configuration file for VitaOxiPad.
This output can be redirected to a `vitaoxipad.toml` file, allowing you to save your configuration options and avoid the need to specify flags each time you run the application.

To create a config file, run the following command:

```bash
VitaOxiPad-x64.exe --sample-config > vitaoxipad.toml
```

This will create a `vitaoxipad.toml` file in the current directory with sample configuration options.

### 3.2 Using a Static IP

If your router allows it, a static IP can be assigned to the PS Vita in the Wi-Fi router settings, allowing this IP address to be saved in the vitaoxipad.toml configuration file.
This setup enables VitaOxiPad to run without the need to specify the IP address as a flag each time.

To set this up, the vitaoxipad.toml file should be edited to include the static IP address in the ip_address field:

```toml
ip = "PSVITA_STATIC_IP_ADDRESS"
```

Now, you can launch VitaOxiPad without any flags, and it will automatically use the IP address specified in the configuration file.

### 3.3 Configurations

There are currently 4 DualShock 4 configuration emulations that can be selected at client startup,
using the `-c`, `--config` flags or conifguration file:

| Configuration name | PS Vita's L1\R1 |       PS Vita's front digitizer        |        PS Vita's rear digitizer        |
| ------------------ | :-------------: | :------------------------------------: | :------------------------------------: |
| `standart`         |      L2\R2      |                 L3\R3                  |                 L1\R1                  |
| `alt_triggers`     |      L1\R1      |                 L3\R3                  |                 L2\R2                  |
| `rear_touchpad`    |      L2\R2      | upper area - L1\R1, lower area - L3\R3 |         DualShock 4 digitizer          |
| `front_touchpad`   |      L2\R2      |         DualShock 4 digitizer          | upper area - L1\R1, lower area - L3\R3 |

To better understand the emulation behavior,
you can run [3D Controller Overlay](http://www.3d-controller-overlay.org/) after connecting your PS Vita for Windows
or [evtest-qt](https://github.com/Grumbel/evtest-qt) for Linux.

## 4. What works

| Feature                         | Support | Details                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | :-----: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dpad, Sticks and Buttons        |    ✅    | All sticks, triggers and buttons, including PS button                                     |
| PS Vita's L1\R1                 |    ✅    | It can be used for L\R presses. For L2\R2, a full press is emulated                       |
| L2\R2 and L3\R3 emulation       |    ✅    | Can be emulated via the PS Vita's rear or front digitizer, as well as the PS Vita's L1\R1 |
| Accelerometer and gyroscope     |    ✅    | A little less accurate than the DualShock 4, but still usable                             |
| DualShock 4 digitizer emulation |    ✅    | Supports front and rear digitizer for multi-touch DualShock 4 emulation                   |
| DualShock 4 digitizer button    |    ✅    | Works as a quick tap on the digitizer. Supports front and rear digitizer                  |
| Any configuration               |    ✅    | You can choose from [ready-made configurations](#33-configurations)                       |
| Changing the sound volume       |    ✅    | Implemented via pressing the PS Vita's volume buttons                                     |
| Battery level                   |    ⚠️    | PS Vita's battery level is sent to the emulated DualShock 4, not used in Linux            |
| Sound streaming                 |    ❌    | Probably will never be realized                                                           |

**Notes for Windows:**

- The gamepad chosen for emulation was a DualShock 4 v1 (`vendor: 0x054C`, `product: 0x05C4`) like connected via USB.
   This allows support for a large number of Windows games without any fixes;
- You can use DS4Windows if you need to. Virtual Controller Support can be found in the [schmaldeo DS4Windows fork](https://github.com/schmaldeo/DS4Windows).
   This option can be found in `Settings -> Device Options -> Virtual Controller Support`.

**Notes for Linux:**

- The behavior closely resembles how the DualShock 4 (`vendor: 0x054C`, `product: 0x9CC`) is defined in Linux. Four `uinput` devices are emulated:
  - Main `uinput` device (Dpad, Sticks, buttons, triggers);
  - Touchpad `uinput` device;
  - Motion Sensors `uinput` device for accelerometer and gyroscope;
  - Keyboard `uinput` device.
- You can also use a convenient input signal remapper, such as [antimicrox](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/)
   or [input-remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper).

## 5. Client and Server compilation

If necessary, you can compile the Client and Server yourself. [Refer to this manual for instructions](./Build.md).

## 6. Notes to developers

If you would like to get involved in the development, please refer to [this guide](./Dev_notes.md). It can help you.

## FAQ

### Q1: Why Oxi?

**A:** Now there are many projects with the name VitaPad. It's very confusing.
In this implementation, the client application was written using **Rust**.
**Oxi** stands for **oxi**dation, the process that causes **rust**ing.

### Q2: Why isn't my PS Vita connecting to the PC?

**A:** Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network and that the IP address entered in the client is correct.

### Q3: I'm experiencing input lag. What can I do?

**A:** Input lag might be due to a poor WiFi connection. Try moving closer to the router or reducing network congestion.

### Q4: How do I update VitaOxiPad?

**A:** Check the [releases page](https://github.com/DvaMishkiLapa/VitaOxiPad/releases) for the latest version and follow the installation instructions provided.
Alternatively, you can use [VitaDB-Downloader](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/VitaDB-Downloader) on your PS Vita.

### Q5: Are there plans to add support for wired connection, Bluetooth, etc.?

**A:** There are no plans to do so in the near future. For wired connection, please refer to other excellent projects like
[ViViD](https://github.com/isage/vivid) or [vitapad by carlelieser](https://github.com/carlelieser/vitapad).
